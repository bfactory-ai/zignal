# Changelog

## [0.9.0] - 2025-12-15

## [0.8.0] - 2025-11-08

### Breaking Changes
- **Matrix Norm APIs**: Replaced the single `Matrix.norm(kind)` entry point with explicit helpers (`frobenius_norm`, `l1_norm`, `max_norm`, `element_norm`, `schatten_norm`, `induced_norm`, `nuclear_norm`, `spectral_norm`) across the Zig core and Python bindings. Update callers to the specific method that matches the desired metric.
- **Mean Pixel Error Scaling**: `Image.meanPixelError` (and the Python `Image.mean_pixel_error`) now returns a normalized value in `[0, 1]` instead of a percentage. Multiply by 100 if you still need percent output.

### Features
- **Geometry Rectangles**: Added center/corner accessors, translation & clipping helpers, and coverage utilities to `Rectangle`, with parity in the Python bindings. Overlaps now treat threshold checks as inclusive so `1.0` truly means “fully covered”.
- **Matrix Norm Suite**: Introduced element-wise, Schatten, induced, nuclear, and spectral norm implementations backed by the improved SVD helpers, plus error reporting when invalid exponents are supplied.
- **Image Loading**: `Image.loadFromBytes` (and Python’s `load_from_bytes`) can decode PNG/JPEG images directly from any byte buffer or buffer-protocol object without hitting the filesystem, sharing the same validation as file-based loads.
- **Color & Canvas Enhancements**: All color structs gain a generic `invert()` method (exposed to Python) and the canvas line renderer now applies fractional endpoint fading for smoother anti-aliased strokes.
- **Image Metrics**: Added `meanPixelError` for structural comparisons alongside PSNR/SSIM, updated examples that visualize the metric suite, and exposed the API to Python.
- **Examples**: New “Contrast Enhancement” WASM demo showcases autocontrast and histogram equalization controls with cleaner web UI wiring.

### Performance
- **Planar Integral Images**: Box-blur and summed-area table routines now use a unified planar integral representation, reusing the optimized kernels per channel to speed up large RGB/RGBA blurs while simplifying the API surface.

### Fixes
- **Matrix Ops**: Binary operations (`add`, `sub`, `times`, `gemm`) now short-circuit when the second operand already carries an error, preventing misleading results.
- **Transforms**: Similarity, affine, and projective fits explicitly return `error.NotConverged`/`error.RankDeficient` when SVD solvers fail, with Python raising `ValueError` for degenerate point sets instead of silently emitting bad matrices.
- **ORB & Feature Matching**: Brute-force matchers only free successfully allocated slices and ORB scale handling no longer panics on `scale_factor <= 1.0`.
- **Canvas**: Thick transparent lines switch to per-pixel blending so alpha is preserved, and docs clarify how `drawLine` blends colors.
- **Fonts**: PCF format flags use the correct masks and bounds checks, while the BDF parser now handles glyph rows wider than 32 bits by decoding hex data byte-by-byte.

### Tooling & Docs
- Updated Python README structure/quickstart, added a download badge, and refreshed example instructions to reflect the new metrics/contrast demos.

## [0.7.1] - 2025-10-24

### Performance
- **Convolution Pipeline**: Added SIMD-accelerated inner loops and early-outs when all three color channels share identical data, cutting blur runtimes substantially on large uniform regions.
- **Terminal Rendering**: Reworked the sixel encoder with improved palette generation, chunking heuristics, and profiling hooks to lower output size and CPU time for high-resolution frames.

### Fixes
- **Matrix GEMM**: Correctly handles `Aᵀ * Bᵀ` paths when dispatching to SIMD kernels, eliminating shape-related crashes in advanced linear algebra workflows.
- **PNG Decoder**: Fixed 16-bit pixel extraction offsets to stop channel swapping in high bit-depth images.
- **JPEG Decoder**: Hardened restart-marker handling and memory management to avoid buffer overruns on truncated streams.
- **Feature Distribution Matching**: Ensures color-source matching respects grayscale targets, yielding stable feature histograms.
- **Rectangle Geometry**: Tightened overlap/containment logic for greater numerical stability in downstream layout calculations.
- **Canvas Drawing**: Floors floating-point coordinates before pixel writes, preventing occasional off-by-one artefacts.

### Internal & Tooling
- **Image Metrics Module**: Consolidated PSNR/SSIM helpers into `image/metrics.zig`, simplifying reuse from examples and keeping `image.zig` lean.
- **Examples**: Added an image-quality metrics showcase and refreshed web demos to highlight the new encoder improvements.

## [0.7.0] - 2025-10-08

### Major Features

#### Image Quality Metrics
- **Structural Similarity Index (SSIM)**: Added `Image.ssim` to compute perceptual similarity using the standard 11×11 Gaussian window and Rec. 709 luminance weighting, with support for grayscale and RGB/RGBA data.

#### Linear Algebra & Geometry
- **Moore–Penrose Pseudoinverse**: Added `Matrix.pseudoInverse` with tolerance controls and rank reporting, enabling stable solutions for rectangular systems.
- **Improved Affine Fitting**: `AffineTransform.init` now uses the pseudoinverse to support overdetermined point sets while preserving numerical stability.

### Breaking Changes
- **Image Processing Outputs**: All image filters and morphology routines now expect the caller to supply an initialized output image (`Image.initLike`/`dupe`). `Image.crop` and `Image.rotate` return freshly allocated images instead of writing through an output pointer.
- **Geometry Point API**: Replace `Point.point(...)` with the new `Point.init(...)` constructor; the legacy helper has been removed.
- **Meta Utilities**: `meta.clampU8`/`clampTo` have been consolidated into the generic `meta.clamp(T, value)` helper and must be updated accordingly.

### Architecture & API Improvements
- **Unified Border Handling**: Introduced `image/border.zig` to centralize zero, replicate, mirror, and wrap modes used across convolution and order-statistic filters.
- **Running Statistics**: `RunningStats` gains an explicit `.init()` constructor, clearer reset semantics, and broader edge-case coverage in tests.
- **Matrix Errors**: Added `MatrixError.NotConverged` so SVD-backed routines report convergence failures instead of silently returning invalid data.

### Performance Optimizations
- **PCA**: SIMD-accelerated `project`/`reconstruct` paths for f32 and f64 reduce latency on high-dimensional datasets.

### Bug Fixes
- **Compression**: Deflate encoder/decoder now clear internal state when reused, preventing cross-run contamination.
- **Canvas**: Row indexing honors image stride, fixing drawing artifacts on non-contiguous buffers.
- **Geometry**: `Rectangle.contains` rejects NaN inputs and `Rectangle.overlaps` correctly enforces the configured IoU threshold.
- **Edge Detection**: Corrected source/destination ordering during gradient copying, fixing regression in the edges module.

### Tooling & Documentation
- **Python Toolchain**: Minimum supported Python bumped to 3.10 with full CI coverage through Python 3.14.
- **Docs**: Expanded Python README with badges, feature overview, and clarified version matrix.
