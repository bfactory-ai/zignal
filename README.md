Zignal is a zero-dependency image processing library heavily inspired by the amazing [dlib](https://dlib.net).

## Disclaimer

This library is in early stages of development and being used internally.
As a result, the API might change often.

## Installation

### Zig

```console
zig fetch --save git+https://github.com/bfactory-ai/zignal
```

Then, in your `build.zig`
```zig
const zignal = b.dependency("zignal", .{ .target = target, .optimize = optimize });
// And assuming that your b.addExecutable `exe`:
exe.root_module.addImport("zignal", zignal.module("zignal"));
// If you're creating a `module` using b.createModule, then:
module.addImport("zignal", zignal.module("zignal"));
```

## Motivation

This library is used by [Ameli](https://ameli.co.kr/) for their makeup virtual try on.

## Acknowledgements

First of all, this project would not have been possible without the existence of [dlib](http://dlib.net).
In fact, the first version of the virtual makeup try on was written in C++ with dlib and Emscripten.
However, we decided to give Zig a go, even if that meant rewriting everything. As a result, we have no dependencies now.

Finally, [B factory, Inc](https://www.bfactory.ai/), which is my employer and graciously agreed to release this library to the public.
