Zignal is an image processing library heavily inspired by the amazing [dlib](http://dlib.net).

## Disclaimer

This library is in early stages of development and being used internally.
As a result, the API might change often.

## Installation

```console
zig fetch --save https://github.com/bfactory-ai/zignal/archive/<commit-hash>.tar.gz
```
or
```console
zig fetch --save https://github.com/bfactory-ai/zignal/archive/master.tar.gz
```

Then, in your `build.zig`
```zig
const zignal = b.dependency("zignal", .{ .target = target, .optimize = optimize });
// And assuming that your b.addExecutable `exe`:
exe.root_module.addImport("zignal", zignal.module("zignal"));
// If you're creating a `module` using b.createModule, then:
module.addImport("zignal", zignal.module("zignal"));
```

## Motivation

This library is used by [Ameli](https://ameli.co.kr/) for their makeup virtual try on.

## Features

Initially, the features in this library are the ones required to get the virtual try on for makeup working.
However, we hope that it can be a foundation from which we can build a high quality image processing library, collaboratively.

Current features include:

- color space conversions
- simple matrix struct with common linear algebra operations
- singular value decomposition (SVD) ported from dlib
- geometry
  - points and rectangles
  - projective, affine and similarity transforms
  - convex hull
- simple image struct with common operations
  - resize
  - rotate
  - crop
  - blur
  - sharpen
  - views (called `sub_image` in dlib or `roi` in OpenCV.)
- Canvas drawing API with consistent parameter ordering
  - lines with variable width and antialiasing
  - circles (filled and outlined) with smooth edges
  - polygons (filled and outlined)
  - rectangles with customizable borders
  - BÃ©zier curves (quadratic and cubic) with adaptive subdivision
  - spline polygons with tension control for smooth curved shapes
  - multiple fill modes: solid (fast) and smooth (antialiased)

## Examples

One of the greatest things about dlib is the large amount of examples illustrating how to use many of that library features.
I plan to showcase most of the features of this library as simple HTML/JS + Wasm examples, which can be accessed from [here](https://bfactory-ai.github.io/zignal/examples/).

Currently, there are examples for:
- [Color space conversions](https://bfactory-ai.github.io/zignal/examples/colorspace.html)
- [Face alignment](https://bfactory-ai.github.io/zignal/examples/face-alignment.html)
- [Perlin noise generation](https://bfactory-ai.github.io/zignal/examples/perlin-noise.html)
- [Seam carving](https://bfactory-ai.github.io/zignal/examples/seam-carving.html)

## Acknowledgements

First of all, this project would not have been possible without the existence of [dlib](http://dlib.net).
In fact, the first version of the virtual makeup try on was written in C++ with dlib and Emscripten.
However, we decided to give Zig a go, even if that meant rewriting the world, but we have no dependencies now.

Finally, [B factory, Inc](https://www.bfactory.ai/), which is my employer and graciously agreed to release this library to the public.
